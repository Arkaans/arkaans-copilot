- Move the user to the temporary channel created
- Delete the temporary channel when the user leave the channel

### Secondary functionnalities
- Get random names to the temporary channels, defined by the target channel
- Use SlashCommands to define what channel is a target channel from id
- Use SlashCommands to define randoms names for a target channel

### Optionnal functionnalities
~ Consider using TypeScript
~ Add a music player feature to the bot
~ Use SlashCommand to show the bot documentation
~ Use SlashCommand to create invitation link to the Arkaans Server
~ Use SlashCommand to spawn coffee
